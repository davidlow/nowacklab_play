# nowacklab_play
This is a sandbox to play with possible features for nowacklab code base

Some of the features are completed.  Some are not.  The status is liable to change without notice.

## Things that work enough for alpha testing:
- threadedplotting/qtexample_data3.py
- threadedplotting/qtexample_data_pyqtgraph2.py
